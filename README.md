# SAS-Work
I have completed Analytics project on real world problem in our life to understand how's my car mileage data could be used to improve and reduce my carbonfoot print. If i should buy fuel efficient car. For quality assessment, I have selected Characterize data under task and utilities. This helps to demonstrate various visual graphs, max, min, frequency of receipts, distribution by year and price. 
2. Analyse Miles, gallon, CO2 emission, mpg- monthly and group by year.
We chose to see summary statistics and comparative box plot to understand spread, extreme values. 
3.Analyzed using Line Chart and Bubble Plot where bubble size give information what is cumulative reduction in Carbon Dioxide.
-First Step to SAS is to Access data
-Explore and Validate Data
-Prepare Data
-Analyze and Report Data
-And lastly. explore Results to understand what we can do next.

I have also attached academic lab work and Project that I have completed during my certification program in Predictive Analytics.
